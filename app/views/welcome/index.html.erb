<p>Looking for a unique tee shirt gift or a tee shirt that expresses your funny side? Have fun wearing a tee
shirt! Just view the tie tee shirts created by RD Novelties and the smiles begin. RD Novelties can also
take a design that you may have in mind and place in on the tie tee shirt for you. If ladies won’t be seen
in a tie, look at the T-shirt vests or the suspender tees. There are tie tee shirts in all sizes, including cute
ones for babies. Want a bow tie t-shirt or suspenders with your tie tee shirt…they are all here for the
asking. Different color tee shirt than white with the ties are no problem either.</p>

<p>RD Novelties use direct print to place the design on the tie and because of this printing the colors don’t
fade and parts of the design will not fall off or melt in the dryer. RD Novelties will work with you if you
have a special idea or want your logo printed in the tie area</p>

<p>For ties already listed in this website just place the order and tee will be mailed within 24 hours of
placed orders during regular business days. If a size is temporarily out of stock, printing can be done
within 24-48 hours and mailed out.</p>
